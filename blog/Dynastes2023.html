      <p>
        <br>This is my first fieldwork experience with <em>Dynastes grantii</em>, specifically focusing on the Sky Islands.</br>
        On the first day, I drove from College Station to Fort Davis and camped there. Fort Davis is a small town that I really like. It only has one gas station and one grocery store. I camped at Fort Davis State Park, and that night, I set up a light sheet and caught some beetles. It was a bit late in the season for <em>Chrysina spp.</em>, but I still found one of my favorites, <em>C. woodii</em>. You can only find <em>C. woodii</em> in West Texas, and compared to other existing species in the U.S., <em>C. woodii</em> has a relatively large body size. What’s special about them is their neon green color with blue tips on their legs.

<p>
  On the second day, I drove all the way to Portal, AZ. I camped in the Chiricahua Mountains and found some dispersed camping areas, so I set up my tent and light sheet. Around 9 PM, I heard a very loud wing noise—like a helicopter. I knew it was Dynastes, so I turned around and saw a female just landing on a tree, maybe 10–15 ft high. This was the first wild D. grantii I had ever seen, and it was for my research, so I climbed the tree and grabbed her. That was the only one I caught on the first night.

  The second Sky Island I visited was Santa Rita mountain. I camped at Madera Canyon and did light-sheeting there. My goal was to get at least three individuals from each population. While I was there, I met some people who were interested in what I was doing. I introduced myself and explained my research, and they stuck around to see what kind of creatures would visit us at night. One of the guys I met was a pro photographer, Chris from Pennsylvania. He took some amazing pictures and was more interested in moths and herps. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91755271@N07/">Chris's flicker</a>)
  He also took some pictures of <em>D. grantii</em> for me. We didn’t exchange contact info, but somehow he found my email and reached out after I got back. There was a 10 PM curfew, and I was struggling to find the last individual I needed. While I was packing up, I shut down the mercury vapor light but left the blacklight on. Then, I heard a hard object hit the ground. it was another female that had landed. So I’d say it turned out to be a good night.

  The last Sky Island I sampled was Mt. Lemmon. The first night was rough. I only got one. So on the second night, I moved to a different location where I thought I might have better luck. The night started very slow, and I almost gave up. I was just walking around when I found a female crawling nearby. I was really excited because it was the last night, and I would head back to Texas the next morning. I told myself it wasn’t a bad trip—at least I caught some <em>D. grantii</em>.
</p>
<p>
  So far, all the <em>D. grantii</em> I had caught were females. I hadn’t seen any males yet. One of the most attractive features of <em>D. grantii</em> is the characteristic big horns the males have. Then, it happened again—while I was packing and turning off the mercury vapor light, a male flew down onto the folded sheet. This was the first wild male, and the only male, I caught on this trip. I slept with a smile that night, and the next morning, I headed back to Texas and returned to civilization.

<p>
  During the trip, I mostly did dispersed camping in primitive areas. Only during the daytime or while on the move would I get some signal to go online and grab a Sonic double cheeseburger. Other than that, I usually cooked hotdogs, potatoes, and beans for meals and worked on my Evolution class homework.
